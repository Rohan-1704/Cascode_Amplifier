# Cascode Amplifier Design

Design of cascode amplifier and cascode current mirror in schematic and layout using LTspice or Cadence and Magic/Cadence tools in 180 nm (supply 1.8 V) technology and
only schematic of cascode amplifier, beta multiplier and cascode current mirror in 22 nm (supply 0.8 V) technology node to see the effect of lowering the technology node.

The target specifications for design are as follows:

• **VDD** = 1.8 V

• **AV** = 20 V/V

• **Power dissipation (PD)** < 5 mW

• **Load Capacitance (CL)** = 1 pF

• **Unity Gain Bandwidth(UGB)** > 500 KHz.
